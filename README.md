#  Patient no-show
This is Machine Learning project to predict no-show of a patient to an appointment on the given time. We used a public dataset of a Brazil Healthcare system from Kaggle with 100k data rows. We also did data analytics to find various factors and comparing them as to which factor affects the probablity of missing an appointment. 

# Methods   
Decision Trees and Bayes  

PR are welcome! I am new to this so I would love to collaborate and make it better. Currently it has an accuracy of 71% only since the age is the only factor deciding the outcome.
